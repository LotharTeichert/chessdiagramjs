The following text is copied from Wikipedia, "Lucena position", on 20.12.2013. 
I want to demonstrate the comfort of living chess diagrams as opposed to
the usual pictures. You may follow the indicated moves by using the buttons
below the diagrams or clicking on the move in the text, and you can try your own moves
by dragging pieces around.
(What is not obvious: if you drop a pawn to its last rank, it is automatically 
promoted to a queen, but you can drag it offboard to get another piece.) 
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<hr /> 
<div id="diag01"></div>
<p>
The Lucena position is named after the Spaniard Luis Ramírez de Lucena, 
although it is something of a misnomer, because the position does not in 
fact appear in his book on chess, <i>Repetición de Amores e Arte de Axedrez</i> (1497). 
It does appear, however, in Alessandro Salvio's <i>Il Puttino</i> (1634), 
a romance on the career of the chess player Leonardo da Cutri, 
and it is in that form that it is given here (Müller & Lamprecht 2001:179).[1] 
Salvio attributes it to Scipione Genovino (Hooper & Whyld 1992:238).
</p><p> 
The position is shown above and below (the position can be moved as a whole or 
mirrored so that the pawn is on any of the files b through g). White's aim is 
to either promote his pawn or else compel Black to give up his rook for it – 
either result will leave White with an overwhelming material advantage and a 
straightforward win. White has managed to advance his pawn to the seventh rank, 
but it is prevented from queening because his own king is in the way. White 
would like to move his king and then promote his pawn, but is prevented from 
moving to the a-file by the black rook, and prevented from moving to the c-file by the black king.
</p>
The essential characteristics of the position are:
<ul>
 <li>the pawn is any pawn except a rook pawn</li>
 <li>the pawn has advanced to the seventh rank</li>
 <li>the attacking king (the one with the pawn) is on the queening square of its pawn</li>
 <li>the attacking rook cuts off the opposing king from the pawn by at least one file</li>
 <li>the defending rook is on the file on the other side of the pawn</li>
</ul>

<h3>The winning method: building a bridge</h3>
<hr />
In the Lucena position, the side with the pawn has a winning method 
that works for any pawn except a rook pawn (i.e. on the a- 
or h-file). In some circumstances, it also works for a rook pawn.

</script>
The black rook can no longer check the white king and Black cannot 
prevent the pawn from queening (Ward 2004:48). White's shielding 
his king and pawn with the rook in this way was described as 
"building a bridge" by Aron Nimzowitsch (Hooper & Whyld 1992:238).

</script>
<p>
Not all similar positions are wins. In this position, Black draws 
because he can safely check from the side. For this defense to 
work, there must be at least three files between the defending 
rook and the attacking king, and the defending king must be 
positioned such that it doesn't block the checks; that is, the 
defending king is on the "short side" of the pawn (the one with 
fewer files between the pawn and the edge of the board) (de la 
Villa 2008:127–28). (See the "short side defense" at rook and pawn 
versus rook endgame for more details.)

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr /> 
<p>
Rook and pawn endgames occur quite often in chess, about eight to 
ten percent of all games (de la Villa 2008:18), (Emms 2008:6). This 
position is very important since endgames may simplify to it. As it 
is a known win, endgames sometimes revolve around the player with 
the pawn trying to reach the Lucena position and the other player 
trying to prevent it.
 </p><p>
There is an alternate method for winning this type of position that 
works only for pawns on the c-file through the f-file (see Rook and 
pawn versus rook endgame).
