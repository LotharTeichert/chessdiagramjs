The following text is copied from Wikipedia, "Lucena position", on 20.12.2013. 
I want to demonstrate the comfort of living chess diagrams as opposed to
the usual pictures. You may follow the indicated moves by using the buttons
below the diagrams, and you can try your own moves (may be illegal) by dragging pieces around.
(What is not obvious: if you drop a pawn to its last rank, it is automatically 
promoted to a queen, but you can drag it offboard to get another piece.) 
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
The Lucena position is named after the Spaniard Luis Ramírez de Lucena, 
although it is something of a misnomer, because the position does not in 
fact appear in his book on chess, <i>Repetición de Amores e Arte de Axedrez</i> (1497). 
It does appear, however, in Alessandro Salvio's <i>Il Puttino</i> (1634), 
a romance on the career of the chess player Leonardo da Cutri, 
and it is in that form that it is given here (Müller & Lamprecht 2001:179).[1] 
Salvio attributes it to Scipione Genovino (Hooper & Whyld 1992:238).
</p><p> 
The position is shown above and below (the position can be moved as a whole or 
mirrored so that the pawn is on any of the files b through g). White's aim is 
to either promote his pawn or else compel Black to give up his rook for it – 
either result will leave White with an overwhelming material advantage and a 
straightforward win. White has managed to advance his pawn to the seventh rank, 
but it is prevented from queening because his own king is in the way. White 
would like to move his king and then promote his pawn, but is prevented from 
moving to the a-file by the black rook, and prevented from moving to the c-file by the black king.
</p>
The essential characteristics of the position are:
<ul>
 <li>the pawn is any pawn except a rook pawn</li>
 <li>the pawn has advanced to the seventh rank</li>
 <li>the attacking king (the one with the pawn) is on the queening square of its pawn</li>
 <li>the attacking rook cuts off the opposing king from the pawn by at least one file</li>
 <li>the defending rook is on the file on the other side of the pawn</li>
</ul>
An obvious approach by White (in the position above) such as
<p>
 <b>1. Rd1+ Ke7 2. Kc7 </b>
</p><p>
gets nowhere. Black can simply harass the white king with checks, and White makes no progress:
</p><p>
 <b>2... Rc2+ 3. Kb6 Rb2+ 4. Ka7 Ra2+ 5. Kb8</b>
</p><p>
<h3>The winning method: building a bridge</h3>
<hr />
In the Lucena position, the side with the pawn has a winning method 
that works for any pawn except a rook pawn (i.e. on the a- 
or h-file). In some circumstances, it also works for a rook pawn.
<div id="diag02"></div>
<script>
ChessDiagram.diagram('diag02', '1K1k4/1P6/8/8/8/8/r7/2R5 w - - 0 1',
'1. Rd1+ Ke7 2. Rd4!  Ra1 ' +
'3. Kc7 Rc1+ 4. Kb6 Rb1+ 5. Kc6 Rc1+ 6. Kb5 Rb1+ 7. Rb4!',
'<b>The Lucena position</b><br />',
'White wins');
</script>
In this position, White can win with
<p>
 <b>1. Rd1+ Ke7 2. Rd4! </b>
</p><p>
Now, if Black plays a waiting move, such as
</p><p>
 <b>2... Ra1</b> 
</p><p>
hoping to harass the white king with checks again as in the above 
variation, White continues
</p><p>
 <b>3. Kc7 Rc1+ 4. Kb6 Rb1+ 5. Kc6 Rc1+</b> 
(Or 5.Ka6 Ra1+.)
 <b>6. Kb5 Rb1+ 7. Rb4!</b> 
</p><p>
The black rook can no longer check the white king and Black cannot 
prevent the pawn from queening (Ward 2004:48). White's shielding 
his king and pawn with the rook in this way was described as 
"building a bridge" by Aron Nimzowitsch (Hooper & Whyld 1992:238).
</p><p style="clear:right">

ChessDiagram.diagram('diag03', '8/1P2k3/1K6/8/3R4/8/8/1r6 w - - 0 5',
'5. Kc6 Ke6 6. Rd6+ Ke7 7. Rd5! Rc1+ 8. Kb6 Rb1+ 9. Rb5 ',
'<b>The Lucena position</b><br />',
'White wins');
</script>
<p>
It is important that the white rook go initially to the fourth rank 
if Black uses his most active defense: repeatedly checking the 
white king. If Black abandons this defense, the white rook can 
build a bridge on the fifth rank. In the line above, after
</p><p>
 <b>5. Kc6 </b>
</p><p>
if Black moves
</p><p>
 <b>5... Ke6 </b>
</p><p>
there is a trap for White: if 6.Rd5?? (to build a bridge on the 
fifth rank) then 6...Rxb7! draws. However, if
</p><p>
 <b>6. Rd6+ </b>
</p><p>
(6.Re4+ followed by either 7.Re8 or (if 7...Kf7) 8.Re5 works as 
well.)
</p><p>
 <b>6... Ke7 7. Rd5! </b>
</p><p>
and White can build a bridge on the fifth rank by getting the rook 
to b5, the king to b6, and then the pawn can promote 
(Ward 2004:48–49) (position reflected):
</p><p>
 <b>7... Rc1+ 8. Kb6 Rb1+ 9. Rb5 </b>
</p><p>
and White wins.
</p><p style="clear:right">
If the defending rook is on the rank that would prevent moving the 
rook to the crucial rank (i.e. 2.Rd4), see Rook and pawn 
versus_rook endgame#Defending rook prevents the bridge.

<h3>Black to move</h3>
<div id="diag04"></div>
<script>
ChessDiagram.diagram('diag04', '1K1k4/1P6/8/8/8/8/r7/2R5 b - - 0 1',
'1... Ra4 2. Rd1+ Ke7 3. Kc7 Rc4+ 4. Kb6 Rb4+ 5. Ka6 Rb2 6. Rd5',
'<b>from Emms</b><br />',
'White wins');
</script>
<p>
If Black is to move in the diagrammed position, he can prevent the 
white rook from going to the fourth rank, but then White still wins:
</p><p>
<b> 1... Ra4 2. Rd1+ Ke7 3. Kc7 Rc4+ 4. Kb6 Rb4+ 5. Ka6 Rb2 </b>
</p><p>
(The black rook is not far enough away to keep checking: if 
5...Ra4+ then 6.Kb5 wins.) Now White wins by blocking the checks 
with
</p><p>
<b> 6. Rd5</b>
</p><p> 
followed by
</p><p>
 <b>7. Rb5</b> (Emms 2008:17) (position reflected). 
</p><p style="clear:right">
<h3>Bridge on the fifth rank</h3>
<div id="diag05"></div>
<script>
ChessDiagram.diagram('diag05', '3K4/3P2k1/8/8/8/8/2r5/5R2 w - - 0 1',
'1. Rf5 Rc1 2. Ke7 Re1+ 3. Kd6 Rd1+ 4. Rd5',
'<b>from de la Villa</b><br />',
'White to move makes a bridge on the fifth rank instead of the fourth rank.');
</script>
<p>
A bridge can also be built on the fifth rank (but it is better to 
build one on the fourth rank). The main line goes:
</p><p>
<b> 1. Rf5</b> 
</p><p>
(Instead of 1.Rf4!)
</p><p>
 <b>1... Rc1 2. Ke7</b> 
</p><p>
Threatening to promote the pawn, Black can just delay it with checks.
</p><p>
<b> 2... Re1+ 3. Kd6 Rd1+ 4. Rd5</b>[2] 
</p><p>
and the pawn will promote. Or
</p><p>
<b> 1... Kg6 2. Ke7?!</b> 
</p><p>
Better is 2.Rf8 Kg7 3.Rf4!, back to a bridge on the fourth rank.
</p><p>
<b> 2... Kxf5! 3. d8=Q</b> 
</p><p>
and White has a winning (but difficult) queen versus rook endgame 
(see pawnless chess endgame) (de la Villa 2008:126–27).
 </p><p style="clear:right">
<h3>Alternate plan for the defense</h3>
<hr />
<div id="diag06"></div>
<script>
ChessDiagram.diagram('diag06', '1K6/1P2k3/8/8/3R4/8/r7/8 b - - 0 1',
'2... Rb2 3. Ra4 Kd7 4. Ka8 Kc7 5. Rc4+',
'<b>from de la Villa</b><br />',
'Alternate plan for Black');
</script>
<p>
Alternative approaches are no better for Black. After 1.Rd1+ Ke7 
2.Rd4 above, after
</p><p>
<b> 2... Rb2 </b>
</p><p>
for example, White can still carry out his plan as above, or he can 
win with the simple
</p><p>
<b> 3. Ra4 Kd7 4. Ka8 (or 4.Ka7) Kc7 5. Rc4+ </b>
</p><p>
which chases the black king away and allows the pawn to promote. 
(Or, 5.b8=Q+ Rxb8 6.Rc4+ wins the rook.)
</p><p style="clear:right"> 
<h3>Rook pawn</h3>
 <hr />
<div id="diag07"></div>
<script>
ChessDiagram.diagram('diag07', 'K7/P4k2/8/8/8/8/1r6/4R3 w - - 0 1',
' 1. Rc1 Ke7 2. Rc8 Kd6! 3. Rb8 Ra2 4. Kb7 Rb2+ 5. Kc8 Rc2+ 6. Kd8 ' + 
'Rh2! 7. Rb6+ Kc5 8. Rc6+! Kxc6 9. a8=Q+',
'<b>Silman, diagram 223</b><br />',
'White wins');
</script>
<p>
The Lucena method also works with a rook pawn if the white rook is 
already on the fourth rank, the black rook is not on the file 
adjacent to the pawn, and White is to move. Otherwise, the 
defending king must be cut off four files from the pawn, as in the 
diagram. This is not a true Lucena position since the king is cut 
off by more than one file. White wins:
</p><p>
<b> 1. Rc1 Ke7 2. Rc8 Kd6! 3. Rb8 Ra2 4. Kb7 Rb2+ 5. Kc8 Rc2+ 6. Kd8 
Rh2! 7. Rb6+ Kc5 8. Rc6+! Kxc6 9. a8=Q+ </b>
</p><p>
and White has a won queen versus rook endgame – one that is easier 
to win than one where the rook is close to its king 
(Silman 2007:223–26).
</p><p style="clear:right"> 
<h3>Similar positions may be drawn</h3>
 <hr />
<div id="diag08"></div>
<script>
ChessDiagram.diagram('diag08', '4K2/4P1k1/8/8/8/8/r7/5R2 b - - 0 1',
'',
'<b>de la Villa, position 10.4</b><br />',
'Black to move draws');
</script>
<p>
Not all similar positions are wins. In this position, Black draws 
because he can safely check from the side. For this defense to 
work, there must be at least three files between the defending 
rook and the attacking king, and the defending king must be 
positioned such that it doesn't block the checks; that is, the 
defending king is on the "short side" of the pawn (the one with 
fewer files between the pawn and the edge of the board) (de la 
Villa 2008:127–28). (See the "short side defense" at rook and pawn 
versus rook endgame for more details.)

<h3>Examples from praxis</h3>
<hr />
 <h4>Rice versus Snape</h4> 
<div id="diag09"></div>
<script>
ChessDiagram.diagram('diag09', '8/5r2/6R1/8/8/8/4K1p1/6k1 b - - 0 81',
'81... Re7+ 82. Kd2 Re5! 83. Rg8 Kf2 84. Rf8+ Kg3 85. Rg8+ Kf3 86. Kd1 Re4',
'<b>Rice vs. Snape, 2000</b><br />',
'Black to move wins using the Lucena position');
</script>
<p>
In this 2000 game between Rice and Ian Snape, Black uses the above 
procedure:
</p><p>
<b> 81... Re7+ 82. Kd2 Re5! 83. Rg8 Kf2 84. Rf8+ Kg3 85. Rg8+ Kf3</b>
</p><p>
Here White deviates from the above:
</p><p>
<b> 86. Kd1 Re4</b> 
</p><p>
White resigns, but the alternative is:
</p><p>
<b> 86. Rf8+ Kg4 87. Rg8+ Rg5</b> 
</p><p>
and Black wins (Snape 2003:36).

'<b>Andersson vs. Åkesson, 1999</b><br />',
'White to move wins');
</script>
<p>
In this position from a 1999 game between Ulf Andersson and Ralf 
Åkesson, White exchanges pawns in order to get to the Lucena 
position.[3]
</p><p>
<b> 79. e4! dxe4 80. Rxe4 Kd7 81. Kg6</b> 
</p><p>
and Black resigned. White will reach a Lucena position: 81...Rg1+ 
82.Kf7 Rf1 83.f6 Rf2 84.Kg7 Rg2+ 85.Kf8 Rf2 86.f7 Rg2 (a Lucena 
position) 87.Rd4+ Kc7 (if 87...Ke6 then 88.Ke8 wins) 88.Ke7 Re2+ 
89. Kf6 Rf2+ 90.Ke6 Re2+ 91.Kf5 Rf2+ 92.Rf4 and White wins (Kaufeld 
&amp; Kern 2011:189).

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr /> 
<p>
Rook and pawn endgames occur quite often in chess, about eight to 
ten percent of all games (de la Villa 2008:18), (Emms 2008:6). This 
position is very important since endgames may simplify to it. As it 
is a known win, endgames sometimes revolve around the player with 
the pawn trying to reach the Lucena position and the other player 
trying to prevent it.
 </p><p>
There is an alternate method for winning this type of position that 
works only for pawns on the c-file through the f-file (see Rook and 
pawn versus rook endgame).
